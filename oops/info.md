**java supports 5 types of inheritance**

1. single inheritance -> single parent class and child class
2. multilevel inheritance -> uppermost parent class and child classes becomes parent to other child classes
3. heirarchial inheritance -> same parent class have multiple child classes
4. multiple inheritance (implemented using *interfaces*)
5. hybrid inheritance (mixture of multilevel and multiple inheritance)
